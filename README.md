# username-generator
Relatively simple username generator

# Arguments
`-n {int}` - Amount of usernames to generate at once. Default: 1

`-w {int}` - Amount of random words the full username should have. Default: 2

`-l {int}` - Maximum word length.

This is NOT the maximum username length. Just the maximum allowed length of the random words that will be used to generate the full username.
