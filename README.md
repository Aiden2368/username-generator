# username-generator
Relatively simple username generator

# Arguments
`-n {int}` - Amount of usernames to generate at once. Default: 1

`-w {int}` - Amount of random words the full username should have. Default: 2

`-l {int}` - Maximum word length. Default: 8
This is NOT the maximum username length. Just the length of the random words that will be used to generate the full username.

# End note
With default settings the script will generate 1x username that's no longer than 16x characters. Said username will consist of 2x words.
